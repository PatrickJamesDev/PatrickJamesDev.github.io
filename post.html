		<h3>Corona Aware</h3>

		<p>This project was created during my first year of university. The project was created in the group of three people,
			including me. I was responsible for databases, users pages and data calculations.
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		User gets to monitor the current corona virus situation worldwide in terms of number of infected individuals, number of cured and lethality. All the news
			are at users disposal in te news section, where the user would not only be able to read news from a i
			diversity of sources, but also has an option to save and store the news in the database.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the users section, user can store information concerning the body temperature, symptoms, and other
			data. This would be helpful to monitor your health condition and patterns as the data can be viewed any time in format
			of data frames or histograms and plots.
		<br>
		<br>
		The entire process took us approximately a couple of weeks as we were new to java and Object-oriented programming.</p>
